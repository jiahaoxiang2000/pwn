## Learning Resources

Each category folder contains:

- `README.md` - Category-specific resources and notes
- Challenge writeups with detailed explanations
- Scripts and tools developed during learning
- Reference materials and cheatsheets

## Progress Tracking

Track your learning progress and completed challenges in each category's README.

## Getting Started

1. Clone this repository
2. Navigate to the category you want to study
